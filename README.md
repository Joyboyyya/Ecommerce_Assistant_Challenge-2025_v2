## Architecture Overview

This project implements a microservices architecture with the following components:

```
E-Commerce Expert Assistant
â”œâ”€â”€ Chat Service (Port 8003)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ LangGraph + Cohere LLM integration
â”œâ”€â”€ Product Service (Port 8001)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ RAG-powered retrieval for product information
â”œâ”€â”€ Order Service (Port 8002)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Order data retrieval via Mock API
â””â”€â”€ Mock API (Port 8000)
    â””â”€â”€ Order data access layer
```

Each service is deployed independently and communicates via RESTful APIs. The architecture allows for easy scaling and maintenance of individual components.

## Services

### Chat Service

The Chat Service is the main interface for users to interact with the chatbot. It routes user queries to the appropriate backend services and integrates a large language model (Cohere) with RAG capabilities.

The Graph compiled to this project is simple yet powerful.

## Sample Questions & Responses

### Product Dataset Queries

**Query**: "What are the top 5 highly-rated guitar products?"

**Response**:
```
The top 5 highly-rated guitar products I could find are:

Fender FA-125 Acoustic Guitar Bundle - a full-size guitar with a natural finish, suited to all styles of music
Imelod Zinc Alloy Guitar Capo Shark Capo - a gold-coloured capo suitable for acoustic and electric guitars
Martin Guitar Lifespan 2.0 MA150T Acoustic Strings - 80/20 bronze, medium-gauge strings for acoustic guitars
Perri's Leathers Guitar Picks - AC/DC-themed 12-pack of medium picks, suitable for acoustic, bass and electric guitars
Another guitar accessory is the Fender FA-115 Dreadnought Acoustic Guitar Bundle, which comes in black.

```

**Query**: "What's a good product for thin guitar strings?"

**Response**:
```
There are a few options for thin guitar strings:

Martin Guitar Lifespan 2.0 MA150T Acoustic Strings - these are medium-gauge, 80/20 bronze strings, which are described as bright and suitable for all playing styles.
Martin MSP4200 Phosphor Bronze Wound Acoustic Guitar Strings - another medium-gauge option, with a bronze winding alloy, designed to deliver deep bases and bright trebles.
Belfort Guitar Strings - a 6-string set made of nylon and silver, with the added bonus of 4 picks. These strings are designed for maximum flexibility.
```

**Query**: "Is the BOYA BYM1 Microphone good for a cello?"

**Response**:
```
I've found the BOYA BYM1 Microphone - it's a clip-on lapel microphone that's compatible with a range of devices including iPhones, Android smartphones, tablets and DSLRs. It's described as ideal for video and audio recording.

However, I couldn't see any reference to its suitability for a cello. I'm afraid this product doesn't appear to be designed with cellos in mind.
```

### Order Dataset Queries

**Query**: "What are the details of my last order?"

**Response**:
```
Sure, I can help with that! Could you please provide your Customer ID?
```

**User**: "37077"

**Response**:
```
Your most recent order, XXXX, was placed on 02/01/2018. It included one Car Media Player, and was paid for using a credit card.

```

**Query**: "Fetch 5 most recent high-priority orders."

**Response**:
```

Here are the details of the 5 most recent high-priority orders:

Order Time: 23:11:40, Product: Car Pillow & Neck Rest, Quantity: 1, Payment: Money Order
Order Time: 23:02:01, Product: Tyre, Quantity: 5, Payment: Credit Card
Order Time: 22:38:45, Product: Shirts, Quantity: 5, Payment: Credit Card
Order Time: 20:22:57, Product: Suits, Quantity: 5, Payment: Credit Card
Order Time: 20:18:43, Product: Car & Bike Care, Quantity: 1, Payment: Credit Card

Let me know if you'd like more details about any of these orders!
```

**Query**: "What is the status of my car body covers?"

**Response**:
```
Please provide your Customer ID to check the status of your car body cover order.
```

**User**: "My Customer ID is 37077."

**Response**:
```
I'm afraid I couldn't find any information about the status of car body covers orders. I did find one order you placed for Auto & Accessories, but it didn't mention car body covers. I apologise for any inconvenience.

Is there anything else I can help you with?

```

## Future Work

Several enhancements are planned for future iterations of this project:

1. **Agent Flow Tracking**: Implement Langsmith or PhoenixAI for better visualization and tracking of agent workflows and decision-making processes.

2. **RAG and Agent Evaluation**: Develop robust evaluation frameworks to measure:
   - Tool selection accuracy (whether agents are calling the appropriate tools)
   - Retrieval precision and recall metrics
   - Overall response quality and relevance

3. **MCP Server Implementation**: Develop Model Control Protocol servers for both product and order services to use with development environments like Cursor AI or Windsurf for improved efficiency.

4. **Hallucination Reduction**: Currently, the system implements parallel requests and selects the first best response to mitigate hallucination issues. Future work will focus on more sophisticated techniques to reduce this inefficiency.

5. **Enhanced UI**: Develop a custom user interface with additional features for a better user experience.

6. **Additional Data Sources**: Integrate with more data sources to expand the chatbot's knowledge base and capabilities.
